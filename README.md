# Cyber Attack Prediction
The goal of the project is building an ML model to be able to predict cyber attacks using a tabular data about the domain.

## Description

Machine learning study on cyber security field which is multi-class classification problem by exploring such dataset where we do not have features which are super easy to be understood. It is going to be interesting to have complicated inputs to feed an algorithm and build a model by improving it.

The aim is to focus deeply on the data, do the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) well and perform the necessary processes. The volume of the dataset is good, it will be good challenge to work with a million of samples and many features to do Feature Reduction & Selection work.

## Dataset
Intrusion Detection in Software Defined Network with 4 different attack categories and harmless category (5 classes at total). To mention its size:

•	80 features 
•	1M+ samples

5 Categories are:

•	DDoS
•	Web Attack - Brute Force
•	Web Attack - XSS
•	Web Attack - Sql Injection
•	Benign (i.e., harmless)
